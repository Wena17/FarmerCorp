                                <p>Farmer Cooperative’s Platform is a community, market platform, and delivery service that supports local farmers. We connect people in the city to fresh food and high-quality local goods that support communities and farmers. We are a local social enterprise that promotes a more conscious way of producing, purchasing and consuming. We also advocate local agriculture, social entrepreneurship, people empowerment and environmentalism.</p>

                                    In this pandemic, necessary travel restrictions and the lockdown in place, some of our local farmers are economically, the hardest hit. In line with this, Farmer Cooperative hopes to help keep livelihoods going, lessen the risk of people going outside and provide healthier food options for everyone.
